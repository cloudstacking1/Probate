                Probate can be a time-consuming and costly process, but it can often be avoided through careful estate planning. Options like creating a living trust, designating beneficiaries on accounts, and holding property jointly can bypass probate and ensure your assets are transferred directly to your heirs without court intervention. Consulting with an experienced estate planning attorney is crucial to setting up these arrangements.
